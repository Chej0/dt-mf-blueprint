# PROJECT BLUE PRINT
This project is the prototype of the new structure of Delta Tracking Platform. The main objective is be able to create a platform with agnostic technologies and and not specifically rely on a language or framework.

In this repo you will see te pretty basic structure of the new platform using Module Federation, Angular, Vue and React as our main technologies.
